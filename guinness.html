<h1 style="color:gray;"> Guinness World Record?</h2>

<p style="font-size:20px;"> Guinness World Records (GWR) is a reference book published every year in different languages around the world. It lists world records of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world.
 
The book was co-founded by twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter in Fleet Street, London, in August 1955. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book series of all time.
 
Beyond publishing, Guinness World Records is now a multi-media brand agency with a wide range of products and services, and a key presence across publishing, television, digital, events, and business solutions.
 
The Guinness World Records maintains a database of more than 40,000 record categories and only about 3,000 of those records get featured on the Guinness World Records website.
 
About 4,000 world records are published in the Guinness World Records books each year. GWR receives over 50,000 inquiries each year from potential record breakers.
 
Guinness World Records maintains a catalogue of existing records and accepts new submissions annually.</p>
