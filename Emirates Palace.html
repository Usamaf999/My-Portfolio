<p style="color:white;  background:black;">The Emirates Palace (Arabic: قصر الإمارات) is a luxury five star hotel in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It has been operated by Mandarin Oriental as of Jan. 1, 2020. 
The hotel project was launched in December 2001 and was initially operated by Kempinski from its opening in Nov. 2005 until Jan. 1, 2020.
Due to the change in management, the Psalace will be renovated over the course of two years, after which it will be fully rebranded as a Mandarin Oriental property.</P>
